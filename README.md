🎬 Movie Recommendation System
This project is a simple content-based movie recommender system built using Python and machine learning libraries. It takes a movie name as input and suggests similar movies based on plot keywords, cast, genres, and crew.

📌 Features
Recommend movies based on content similarity

Uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques

Built with pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK

Works in a Jupyter Notebook

Accepts user input for dynamic recommendations

📽️ How It Works
Data is preprocessed by combining important features (cast, keywords, genres, overview) into a single "tag" column.

CountVectorizer converts the combined tags into vectors.

Cosine similarity is computed between movie vectors.

The user inputs a movie name, and the system returns the top 5 most similar movies.

🧪 Example Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter a movie name: Avatar

Recommended movies:
- Avengers: Endgame
- Guardians of the Galaxy
- Interstellar
- Iron Man
- The Matrix
🛠️ Installation
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Install the required libraries with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
📚 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

nltk

📁 Dataset
You can use the TMDB movie metadata dataset from Kaggle:

Download TMDB Movie Metadata Dataset

Make sure your dataset includes columns such as:
title, genres, cast, keywords, overview

▶️ How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook file movie_recommender.ipynb

Run all cells step-by-step

When prompted, enter a movie name to get recommendations

✅ To Do / Future Improvements
Add fuzzy string matching to handle misspelled or partial movie titles using libraries like fuzzywuzzy or RapidFuzz

Deploy the recommender system as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

Enhance recommendations by experimenting with TF-IDF vectorization or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT)

Integrate user ratings or collaborative filtering for hybrid recommendations
